* Meeting of DGC (Deparment of Oromo Language Literature and Folklore)
We had a very long meeting at the deprtment head. Main and relevant agendas were concern MA thesis defence and assignment of supervisors. We had also discussed on my students who got grade of NG in First language and Oromo Phonology and Morophology. But, we took a lot of time on discussing irrelevant matter that is if we have to represent DGC member for a newly launched translation MA programme co-ordinated by The Department of Linguistics. After a meeting of 4 hours I returned home and had my lunch. In fact it was extremely tiresome.
